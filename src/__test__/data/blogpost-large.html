We have plenty of action items coming up, let's get these on the
radar so we can plan effectively. </P>
<ul>

<li> The <em>class</em> repo has a template for the IDP (individual development plan) such 
as will be used in our lab on Thursday. We will illustrate how to use this, and later invite 
everyone to go over your Gallup materials in far more detail. Let's get full value. After
the lab, ttudy your support material, then conduct the IDP exercise thoughtfully, fill out 
the IDP, and upload it to your personal folder (file "idp.*" appropriate to the format.) We 
will also use this at end of the semester in order to shed light on how teaming worked out.</li>

<li> All students have unlimited access to LinkedIn Learning, through the
<A HREF="https://linkedinlearning.umd.edu/" target="_blank">campus portal</A>. You may
recognize these from Lynda Training, which became incorporated into LI. You can't beat
the price and most of the materials of specific to us are compact. They won't chew up
more of your time than necessary. I strongly recommend you mine that resource for tips. 
Check out in particular Chris Croft's
course on <em>Teamwork Foundations</em>, the site's business tutorials 
<em>Top 10 project management mistakes and how to avoid them</em> and
<em>Project management mistakes</em>.  </li>

<li> We practice more tasks in the small (for cheap) in order have confidence later
when things become large (and expensive.) 
Mailtools is a Linux-based system created in a prior 435.  
All present 435 students should be able to access this project in our repository at
        https://vis.cs.umd.edu/svn/projects/mailtools/src
(using appropriate SVN tools, of course.)
The simple (individual) exercise is to tell us about its "Space Invader" feature.
Who was its author, and how many commits are related to it (<u>just</u> this feature,
not the full Mailtools product)?
Don't agonize over answers; derive reasonable responses for each of the above questions,
place your answers in a file "svnfun.txt" and check it into the root folder of your personal 
repository by 0700 on Wed, February 3rd. </li>
</ul>

<p> The first <em>group</em> scrimmage is a two-foot putt:  By 0700 on Friday, February 5th,
set up your assigned VM as a web server. Put up something that convinces skeptical visitors to
the site that the server is talking with some kind of database. Ensure your VM itself evidences 
decent care, maintenance and security. Per conventions for group assignments, please submit a 
cover sheet, according to the conventions for digital signatures with the template in your group 
folder.  This exercise will serve as a forcing function to get everyone on to a group in some form 
or other; it will let us practice conventions for projects; and it will be a good opportunity
to practice following our "do the right thing" directive.</P>

<P> Heads up! Scrimmage exercise 2 will be due at COB that same Friday.  This is also an easy 
target (problem statement is below), but will require talking with your group in order to sort 
it out.  Write a "plan" for how you intend to solve the problem. The deliverable is this document 
in Word format as "scrimmage02.docx". It should persuade me as an ostensible product
manager that you are on track and can solve my problem.</P>

<P> Scrimmage exercise 3 is due at COB the following Friday (12 February.) For this just follow 
your plan, collect solutions and tell me how to find more such solutions on your VM.
(Foreshadowing: by that point we will have surveyed all sorts of simple ways that some
product can fail for want of technologists anticipating what users actually need. Your
mission is not to replicate such defects in this exercise! Don't just write a program;
write a reasonable program that lets me solve problems.)</P>

<P><strong>The problem to solve</strong> for the above is this: For input of a closed
curve in 2-space, find four points on that curve which form a rectangle.</P>

<P>There, how's that for simple?</P>

<P> A few details you might need to know:</P>
<ol>
<li> We're not defining many details. "Do the right thing." By now I hope you're all
figuring out that ambiguity is something we erase by exercising initiative to find
what is necessary for mission success, not something we interpret for convenience.
The 'client' in this problem seeks a reasonable way to find these points; help him get them.  </li>
<li> Limit work to the VM as assigned. Figuring out how to manage the shared resource
and fit a solution inside is part of the exercise. Back doors to AWS servers won't fly. </li>
<li> Anticipate offering a feature to confirm that points form a rectangle and are on
a given curve, so we have the option to check each other's work later. </li>
<li> I'll offer sample data in the class repo later, but anticipate these
will be X/Y pairs in a text file, representing a sequence of piecewise linear
segments which make up the curve. An implied segment will connect the last to the first
point. In testing we will try other data of interest to the client. </li>
<li> The above computation reaches
baseline goals. For those who find that computation too easy, we'll also look for not 
just <em>any</em> rectangle, but also one having specific ratio of lengths of its sides.
</li>
</ol>
