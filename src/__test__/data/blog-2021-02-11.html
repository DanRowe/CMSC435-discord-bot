      Today ended up being the lab we might have run last Thursday, but lots of discussion about
      peer mentoring and tickets. </P>
    <P>To share with everyone an answer to the good question just posed: changing values on the
      engagement poll might require <strong>un</strong>checking an original section then checking
      the new preference. </P>

      Off and running in a new work week. Where are we with the projects? Are they done yet?</P>
    <P>If not then we should have in mind what path is going to get us there. It is still early
      of course, with much yet to learn about the problem space, but ambiguity and haze around a
      path does not justify having <em>no</em> path, which as we have been studying in class, is
      called a <em>plan</em>. Lack of a plan could be misinterpreted as release to do nothing. I
      guarantee you that is not the way to success. </P>
    <P>We probably don't know how to work the big problem yet. Okay, what's necessary for us to
      work the problem of <em>finding</em> what is needed for the big problem? Work that out. And
      repeat. Apply Purtilo's First Law: <u>Do the right thing or do the wrong thing but just do
        <em>some</em>thing</u>. For which the corollary is: <u>... do it right the bleep now</u>,
      and harvest the features it offers you to win a better tactical angle on the problem. Just
      me speculating now, but I bet everyone will want to arrive at class on Tuesday able to
      articulate the <u>specific</u> tasks we have individually accomplished and are working on
      toward this end. And in our world, thinking is not a substitute for doing.</P>
    <P>Thanks for the 400-level course survey last week. (Also, sorry a few did not offer data
      in time to be harvested for the metrics. Let's resolve to do better moving forward.) This
      week's measurements are two easy tasks. First, we open the first offering of our engagement
      metrics. This is on the mentors site (under polls) where it has been open for a bit. If you
      tried it already, thanks, you can still update it before the instrument closes at <strong>5PM
        on Friday</strong>. We'll speak to this on Tuesday.</P>
    <P>Also, this week we start offering mentoring tips for team members. This is also on the
      mentors site, and also can be updated throughout the week. We will also speak to this in
      class shortly, but give it a try. We'll practice it this week before doing it for credit
      starting next week. </P>

      Nice to see teams jumping on the problem fast! Thanks for that - it bodes
      well for some great projects this semester. Now, what about the weekend reflection? Let's think of
      the issues that arose during scrimmages, then wonder how we can avoid duplicating them in the big
      project. Let's think of those principles too. Remember them? Try 'em out for size. See what value
      they bring us now. How about that one about <em>risk</em>? We will of course spend time looking at
      properties we know about the project, but why not exercise discipline and think hard about what we
      <em>don't</em> know? Then as a planning exercise: maybe that tells us a few things to do. Early
      tasks might be ones to knock down the list of risks and unknowns. Find small investments of effort
      which offer greatest insight about the problem space. And finally ... reflect on the timeline too.
      Today is a better market for buying room to work than in April. It gets way more expensive to find
      time and flexibility later.

      Let's underscore something about the charter. This isn't a document
      for <em>me</em> so much as it is a document for <em>you</em>. I've asserted that the most
      important component in a successful project is a team's foundation, and we illustrated this
      in small ways with the scrimmages. I'll assert that this is true for bigger projects as well,
      where success will depend on strong levels of commitment, trust and communication. The class
      project will illustrate this too I bet. </P>
    <P>We don't get such trust over night! But what we can do is take first steps toward having
      enduring relationships that will sustain us when a project becomes interesting. A chartering
      document will simply memoize this beginning.</P>
    <P>So we all should think about what makes a good starting point. Probably an exhausting
      inventory of specific roles is going to be something which changes. After all, we're still
      learning about the tasks and roles might even need to be in software engineering. But as a
      pro tip: If we can't get a commitment on when we will all meet each week, then we probably
      can't get a serious commitment on what we will <em>do</em> each week and how we will know
      it has been done well. Get the early buy-in from all team members; sooner will be better
      than later to get team basics figured out. (And this includes any needed re-teaming in case
      we are not hearing from everyone.) </P>
    <P>And finally, as to team structure: I've intentionally left this unspecified. Figure it out.
      Better yet, <em>do the right thing</em>. There are many ways to self-organize, and typically
      435 will see a variety emerge by end of semester. Do we drive it by tasks? Strengths? Does one
      or another responsibility rotate? How do we decide - voting? Chief programmer rules? Can we
      architect a solution path that dovetails with team capabilities? (Spoiler: yes...) Do we want
      eight people coding eight independent components or do we get better mileage by having four
      subgroups pair-program? How does that team capacity map to the Gantt chart of tasks which we
      might eventually derive in the Green Light proposal? And so on.</P>
    <P> This is a little less efficient than for me to just say "here do this!" but by May I bet
      we'll know more about how to do it and why we care. Plan on a robust conversation later as we
      compare what the teams choose for organization and process.</P>

      So we did scrimmages to practice getting to know one another,
      creating plans and meeting objectives efficiently, even if in the small. Part of that
      involved talking with one another about what we bring to the game. I bet it wouldn't
      be out of the question that teams bring out, oh, maybe the Gallup strengths to share?

      Scrimmages are a wrap! I'm grading at best speed and will have the
      summary notes in repo once all are completed. With any kind of tail wind I should have the
      tasking for class projects out by start of business on Monday. </P>
    <P> Meanwhile, a few thoughts for your weekend reflection ... </P>
    <P> In the scrimmage we gave a clear end state and invited all to figure out how to fill in
      the gap so we could get there. How did this work out? Someone who offers you a detailed rubric
      about such steps should be taken has already made the hard decisions; writing a program that
      follows the plan takes talent but nothing deep. The fun, leverage and reward is in knowing how
      to craft good targets, plan how to get there and lead a team to that goal.</P>
    <P> Did you have a frenetic last day or two? What would have made this easier had it been on
      your radar earlier? What were the changes you made, how much did you backtrack, where could
      you have found savings? <em>How could you be better able to tell such things?</em> Questions
      like these are what the class is about. </P>
    <P> After our lab discussion on repo management I love how teams made copies of the data files
      rather than link to it (and get the automatic update value.) Oh, we'll have so much to talk
      about. </P>
    <P>Meanwhile, happy new year!</P>

how to fill in detail when there is ambiguity, we're practicing how to anticipate consequences
of technical decisions so those we make will bring us to a good place. Think about how your
Strengths are reflected in team performance to date, and talk openly with one another about

      Rather than risk being too subtle, even though we emphasized this
on Tuesday, let's just mention again. There should be no mystery about what unfolds in the
in the sessions to come. What we're reading in our support materials will paint a picture 
in the large of things we trying out in assignments, illustrating those points in the small. 
Magically, these all seem to go together, and class is when we work to make those connections 
very concrete. In fact, they will dovetail all the way through to May 17th, which is when we 
finish the final exam. Humor me. Give the exercises a try.

    <P><strong>2021-01-27</strong>
      We have plenty of action items coming up, let's get these on the
radar so we can plan effectively. </P>
<ul>

<li> The <em>class</em> repo has a template for the IDP (individual development plan) such 
as will be used in our lab on Thursday. We will illustrate how to use this, and later invite 
everyone to go over your Gallup materials in far more detail. Let's get full value. After
the lab, ttudy your support material, then conduct the IDP exercise thoughtfully, fill out 
the IDP, and upload it to your personal folder (file "idp.*" appropriate to the format.) We 
will also use this at end of the semester in order to shed light on how teaming worked out.</li>

<li> All students have unlimited access to LinkedIn Learning, through the
<A HREF="https://linkedinlearning.umd.edu/" target="_blank">campus portal</A>. You may
recognize these from Lynda Training, which became incorporated into LI. You can't beat
the price and most of the materials of specific to us are compact. They won't chew up
more of your time than necessary. I strongly recommend you mine that resource for tips. 
Check out in particular Chris Croft's
course on <em>Teamwork Foundations</em>, the site's business tutorials 
<em>Top 10 project management mistakes and how to avoid them</em> and
<em>Project management mistakes</em>.  </li>

<li> We practice more tasks in the small (for cheap) in order have confidence later
when things become large (and expensive.) 
Mailtools is a Linux-based system created in a prior 435.  
All present 435 students should be able to access this project in our repository at
        https://vis.cs.umd.edu/svn/projects/mailtools/src
(using appropriate SVN tools, of course.)
The simple (individual) exercise is to tell us about its "Space Invader" feature.
Who was its author, and how many commits are related to it (<u>just</u> this feature,
not the full Mailtools product)?
Don't agonize over answers; derive reasonable responses for each of the above questions,
place your answers in a file "svnfun.txt" and check it into the root folder of your personal 
repository by 0700 on Wed, February 3rd. </li>
</ul>

<p> The first <em>group</em> scrimmage is a two-foot putt:  By 0700 on Friday, February 5th,
set up your assigned VM as a web server. Put up something that convinces skeptical visitors to
the site that the server is talking with some kind of database. Ensure your VM itself evidences 
decent care, maintenance and security. Per conventions for group assignments, please submit a 
cover sheet, according to the conventions for digital signatures with the template in your group 
folder.  This exercise will serve as a forcing function to get everyone on to a group in some form 
or other; it will let us practice conventions for projects; and it will be a good opportunity
to practice following our "do the right thing" directive.</P>

<P> Heads up! Scrimmage exercise 2 will be due at COB that same Friday.  This is also an easy 
target (problem statement is below), but will require talking with your group in order to sort 
it out.  Write a "plan" for how you intend to solve the problem. The deliverable is this document 
in Word format as "scrimmage02.docx". It should persuade me as an ostensible product
manager that you are on track and can solve my problem.</P>

<P> Scrimmage exercise 3 is due at COB the following Friday (12 February.) For this just follow 
your plan, collect solutions and tell me how to find more such solutions on your VM.
(Foreshadowing: by that point we will have surveyed all sorts of simple ways that some
product can fail for want of technologists anticipating what users actually need. Your
mission is not to replicate such defects in this exercise! Don't just write a program;
write a reasonable program that lets me solve problems.)</P>

<P><strong>The problem to solve</strong> for the above is this: For input of a closed
curve in 2-space, find four points on that curve which form a rectangle.</P>

<P>There, how's that for simple?</P>

<P> A few details you might need to know:</P>
<ol>
<li> We're not defining many details. "Do the right thing." By now I hope you're all
figuring out that ambiguity is something we erase by exercising initiative to find
what is necessary for mission success, not something we interpret for convenience.
The 'client' in this problem seeks a reasonable way to find these points; help him get them.  </li>
<li> Limit work to the VM as assigned. Figuring out how to manage the shared resource
and fit a solution inside is part of the exercise. Back doors to AWS servers won't fly. </li>
<li> Anticipate offering a feature to confirm that points form a rectangle and are on
a given curve, so we have the option to check each other's work later. </li>
<li> I'll offer sample data in the class repo later, but anticipate these
will be X/Y pairs in a text file, representing a sequence of piecewise linear
segments which make up the curve. An implied segment will connect the last to the first
point. In testing we will try other data of interest to the client. </li>
<li> The above computation reaches
baseline goals. For those who find that computation too easy, we'll also look for not 
just <em>any</em> rectangle, but also one having specific ratio of lengths of its sides.
</li>
</ol>

clear about what we're getting into by reviewing the guide <em><A HREF="isitforme.html">Is 
435 right for me?</A></em></P></li>

<li> <P> <strong>Get an early start on the first assignments!</strong>  
Getting these very small tasks out of the way will keep the decks cleared 
for more interesting things once the semester arrives.</P>
<ol>
<li> <em>Purchase your Clifton Strengths assessment.</em> This skills assessment is
for our exercises on team building and is available to you for a student discounted
rate from the folks at Gallup:
<A HREF="https://www.strengthsquest.com/192614/purchase.aspx"
target="_blank">Clifton Strengths</A>
(The "Top 5" report is adequate for our needs and much less expensive.)
Save and study the PDF reports you receive;
place the <em>Signature Themes Report</em> (the PDF document which is specific to you) in 
your Subversion folder (which you will receive first day of semester.)</li>
<li><em>Update your resume.</em> Prepare this as a PDF document.
Please only share details with which you are comfortable. We use the content
later in sorting out talents for teams and projects, and to figure out early who knows how
to follow directions (which is one of the most basic skill sets of our business.)
Place this in a PDF document "resume.pdf" in your repository folder as well.
</li>
<li><em>Prepare a thoughtful statement of what you want to get out of 435.</em>
Craft this as a Word document, and place it in your Subversion folder as file "goals.docx".
</li>
</ol>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P> In general we judge more than just the payload of your submissions, so please remember 
that evidence of timeliness, preparation and planning always count. <u>Everything you
do reflects on you</u>. </P></li>
<li><P><strong>Students on the waitlist</strong> should plan to attend the class from day one and 
perform the above assignments in anticipation of being admitted to the section. 
We only issue repository credentials to enrolled students, so if (and only if) you
are on the waitlist then email the professor with your submissions attached before the
deadlines; this will ensure your work is treated as on-time should you be able to add
the class later.</P></li>

<LI><P><strong>Pro tip:</strong> Commit to success from day one.
The best way to get off on the wrong foot is to join us late 
without having attended, then try to browbeat us into offering credit for assignments that
your classmates managed to complete on time. In our view, planning, participation and timely 
attention to detail has greater value as <em>not</em> participating or attending to details. 
We use workmanship on early assignments when making decisions on teaming and tasking, so 
consider seriously what we would have to work with.
Overall, <u>exercise of initiative in the interest of quality is rewarded</u>, so pay attention,
demonstrate decent critical thinking skills and focus on success from the start. Do that and
we'll make the semester worth your while. </P></li>

<li><strong>Assignments</strong> On the first day of the semester we will email you a Zoom
access link for class plus credentials for access to the class repository (which is one of 
several ways we will communicate this semester.) Your first assignments (as above) will be 
due by SOB on Thursday, January&nbsp;28th.
