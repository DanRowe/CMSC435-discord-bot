<!-- for weekend reflection:
we gave a clear end state and invited you to figure out how to fill in the gap so we could get
there. how did you? someone who fills out a detailed rubric about such steps has already made
the hard decisions. writing a program to do that takes some talent but nothing deep. the fun,
leverage and reward is in knowing how to craft good targets, plan how to get there and lead a
team to win that success.
what did you finding out frenetically in the last few days which would have been easier to do
had it been on the radar earlier? what were the changes you made, how much did you backtrack,
where were the savings? how could you be better able to tell such things?

<tr><td><A id="2021-02-11"></A><P><strong>2021-02-11</strong>
 Today we conclude our discussion of the principles, recognizing
that our mission through the balance of the semester is to look for ways to apply them in
the class project, then assess what are their effects. </P></td></tr>

<tr><td><A id="2021-02-09"></A><P><strong>2021-02-09</strong>
 We led off with a mini-lab about planning and in particular talked
about how to relate these points to the scrimmages. We continued on with discussion about
principles, which form a framework that guides us in our processes. We got most of the way
through, and will finish up this discussion on Thursday, in particular with very specific
points about why we care. </P></td></tr>

<tr><td><A id="2021-02-08"></A><P><strong>2021-02-08</strong>
 We'll be measuring or surveying something each week for the near
term, and this week is a very short instrument about how your scrimmage group has worked
out. A text file with a couple short questions is in your personal folder now; at end of
the week (but in any case before 6PM Friday) please tell us briefly who did what on the
scrimmage and how eager you would be to team with them again. Update this file and check
in. </P></td></tr>

<tr><td><A id="2021-02-06"></A><P><strong>2021-02-06</strong>
 Grading is up to date. Rough notes on scrimmages are pushed to the
repo, and we will go over the plans in far greater detail in lab. </P></td></tr>

<tr><td><A id="2021-02-05"></A><P><strong>2021-02-05</strong>
 Another week in the rack. I'm grading now at best speed and will
release terse grading notes for each team once all are completed. For now, reflect on where
we have come so far! We're grappling with the nuances of what make a good plan, we're learning
how to fill in detail when there is ambiguity, we're practicing how to anticipate consequences
of technical decisions so those we make will bring us to a good place. Think about how your
Strengths are reflected in team performance to date, and talk openly with one another about
how everyone can up our game for a better team product.</P>
<P> And take a break this weekend too. Yes, that is an assignment. We work <em>hard</em> during
the week; weekend is time to rest and reflect.  </P>
<P> Sample test data for the rectangle problem are now in class repo too. </P>
</td></tr>

<tr><td><A id="2021-02-04a"></A><P><strong>2021-02-04</strong>
 Discussion today on process models and why we care about them. </P>
<P>Update ...</P>

</td></tr>

<tr><td><A id="2021-02-02"></A><P><strong>2021-02-02</strong>
 Discussion today characterized software engineering as an exercise
in communication. We illustrated this point with a variety of case studies which showed how
SE had not been done effectively - all related to failures in communication of one kind or
another. </P></td></tr>

<tr><td><A id="2021-01-28"></A><P><strong>2021-01-28</strong>
 Lab today involved going over our Strengths - what we bring to a
team in a project. Let's find out what we do best and how these superhero powers blend
with others in order to make for winning projects. </P></td></tr>

<tr><td><A id="2021-01-27a"></A><P><strong>2021-01-27</strong>
 Rather than risk being too subtle, even though we emphasized this
on Tuesday, let's just mention again. There should be no mystery about what unfolds in the
in the sessions to come. What we're reading in our support materials will paint a picture
in the large of things we trying out in assignments, illustrating those points in the small.
Magically, these all seem to go together, and class is when we work to make those connections
very concrete. In fact, they will dovetail all the way through to May 17th, which is when we
finish the final exam. Humor me. Give the exercises a try.
</P></td></tr>

<tr><td><A id="2021-01-27"></A><P><strong>2021-01-27</strong>
 We have plenty of action items coming up, let's get these on the
radar so we can plan effectively. </P>
<ul>

<li> The <em>class</em> repo has a template for the IDP (individual development plan) such
as will be used in our lab on Thursday. We will illustrate how to use this, and later invite
everyone to go over your Gallup materials in far more detail. Let's get full value. After
the lab, ttudy your support material, then conduct the IDP exercise thoughtfully, fill out
the IDP, and upload it to your personal folder (file "idp.*" appropriate to the format.) We
will also use this at end of the semester in order to shed light on how teaming worked out.</li>

<li> All students have unlimited access to LinkedIn Learning, through the
<A HREF="https://linkedinlearning.umd.edu/" target="_blank">campus portal</A>. You may
recognize these from Lynda Training, which became incorporated into LI. You can't beat
the price and most of the materials of specific to us are compact. They won't chew up
more of your time than necessary. I strongly recommend you mine that resource for tips.
Check out in particular Chris Croft's
course on <em>Teamwork Foundations</em>, the site's business tutorials
<em>Top 10 project management mistakes and how to avoid them</em> and
<em>Project management mistakes</em>.  </li>

<li> We practice more tasks in the small (for cheap) in order have confidence later
when things become large (and expensive.)
Mailtools is a Linux-based system created in a prior 435.
All present 435 students should be able to access this project in our repository at
        https://vis.cs.umd.edu/svn/projects/mailtools/src
(using appropriate SVN tools, of course.)
The simple (individual) exercise is to tell us about its "Space Invader" feature.
Who was its author, and how many commits are related to it (<u>just</u> this feature,
not the full Mailtools product)?
Don't agonize over answers; derive reasonable responses for each of the above questions,
place your answers in a file "svnfun.txt" and check it into the root folder of your personal
repository by 0700 on Wed, February 3rd. </li>
</ul>

<p> The first <em>group</em> scrimmage is a two-foot putt:  By 0700 on Friday, February 5th,
set up your assigned VM as a web server. Put up something that convinces skeptical visitors to
the site that the server is talking with some kind of database. Ensure your VM itself evidences
decent care, maintenance and security. Per conventions for group assignments, please submit a
cover sheet, according to the conventions for digital signatures with the template in your group
folder.  This exercise will serve as a forcing function to get everyone on to a group in some form
or other; it will let us practice conventions for projects; and it will be a good opportunity
to practice following our "do the right thing" directive.</P>

<P> Heads up! Scrimmage exercise 2 will be due at COB that same Friday.  This is also an easy
target (problem statement is below), but will require talking with your group in order to sort
it out.  Write a "plan" for how you intend to solve the problem. The deliverable is this document
in Word format as "scrimmage02.docx". It should persuade me as an ostensible product
manager that you are on track and can solve my problem.</P>

<P> Scrimmage exercise 3 is due at COB the following Friday (12 February.) For this just follow
your plan, collect solutions and tell me how to find more such solutions on your VM.
(Foreshadowing: by that point we will have surveyed all sorts of simple ways that some
product can fail for want of technologists anticipating what users actually need. Your
mission is not to replicate such defects in this exercise! Don't just write a program;
write a reasonable program that lets me solve problems.)</P>

<P><strong>The problem to solve</strong> for the above is this: For input of a closed
curve in 2-space, find four points on that curve which form a rectangle.</P>

<P>There, how's that for simple?</P>

<P> A few details you might need to know:</P>
<ol>
<li> We're not defining many details. "Do the right thing." By now I hope you're all
figuring out that ambiguity is something we erase by exercising initiative to find
what is necessary for mission success, not something we interpret for convenience.
The 'client' in this problem seeks a reasonable way to find these points; help him get them.  </li>
<li> Limit work to the VM as assigned. Figuring out how to manage the shared resource
and fit a solution inside is part of the exercise. Back doors to AWS servers won't fly. </li>
<li> Anticipate offering a feature to confirm that points form a rectangle and are on
a given curve, so we have the option to check each other's work later. </li>
<li> I'll offer sample data in the class repo later, but anticipate these
will be X/Y pairs in a text file, representing a sequence of piecewise linear
segments which make up the curve. An implied segment will connect the last to the first
point. In testing we will try other data of interest to the client. </li>
<li> The above computation reaches
baseline goals. For those who find that computation too easy, we'll also look for not
just <em>any</em> rectangle, but also one having specific ratio of lengths of its sides.
</li>
</ol>

 We're off and running with first day of class. We spent discussion
today setting expectations of one another for the semester. Our action items for Thursday
are as already announced earlier in the blog. Keep interacting with one another to form a
team; send me the directory IDs of your four person team and I will issue you a group repo
which also gets you access to your VM. Feel free to get settled in there in anticipation
of our first simple group project in the coming week.  </P>
<P> Lab on Thursday will be the start of our work on team formation and strengths.
Bring your Gallup materials! </P>

 We get a great teachable moment in
<A HREF="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TtGQnyPZ6g" target="_blank">dependency and
change management</A> with discovery that Apple took <em>subversion</em> out of the Xcode
kit at release of Big Sur. No worries - Fearless Terps who run the latest MacOS will overcome,
adapt and improvise, and in this case it is a

command line.</P></td></tr>

 And we're off on a new semester. Creds to access our Zoom room and
repository are mailed to everyone registered or waitlisted in the class as of Monday morning.
Usual drill: if you don't see it right away, check spam folder. If you join the waitlist late
then contact the instructor directly for Zoom information. </P>
<P> The first assignments are exactly as posted on 24 December entry below; time to get started.
Review the syllabus in detail and we'll see you Tuesday! </P></td></tr>

<tr><td><A id="2020-12-24"></A><P><strong>2020-12-24</strong>
 A new semester is just around the corner.
The first assignments are as below so you can get an early start.
<ul>

<li><P><strong>Review our guide on Expectations Management!</strong> Please make sure we are all
clear about what we're getting into by reviewing the guide <em><A HREF="isitforme.html">Is
435 right for me?</A></em></P></li>

<li> <P> <strong>Get an early start on the first assignments!</strong>
Getting these very small tasks out of the way will keep the decks cleared
for more interesting things once the semester arrives.</P>
<ol>
<li> <em>Purchase your Clifton Strengths assessment.</em> This skills assessment is
for our exercises on team building and is available to you for a student discounted
rate from the folks at Gallup:
<A HREF="https://www.strengthsquest.com/192614/purchase.aspx"
target="_blank">Clifton Strengths</A>
(The "Top 5" report is adequate for our needs and much less expensive.)
Save and study the PDF reports you receive;
place the <em>Signature Themes Report</em> (the PDF document which is specific to you) in
your Subversion folder (which you will receive first day of semester.)</li>
<li><em>Update your resume.</em> Prepare this as a PDF document.
Please only share details with which you are comfortable. We use the content
later in sorting out talents for teams and projects, and to figure out early who knows how
to follow directions (which is one of the most basic skill sets of our business.)
Place this in a PDF document "resume.pdf" in your repository folder as well.
</li>
<li><em>Prepare a thoughtful statement of what you want to get out of 435.</em>
Craft this as a Word document, and place it in your Subversion folder as file "goals.docx".
</li>
</ol>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P> In general we judge more than just the payload of your submissions, so please remember
that evidence of timeliness, preparation and planning always count. <u>Everything you
do reflects on you</u>. </P></li>
<li><P><strong>Students on the waitlist</strong> should plan to attend the class from day one and
perform the above assignments in anticipation of being admitted to the section.
We only issue repository credentials to enrolled students, so if (and only if) you
are on the waitlist then email the professor with your submissions attached before the
deadlines; this will ensure your work is treated as on-time should you be able to add
the class later.</P></li>

<LI><P><strong>Pro tip:</strong> Commit to success from day one.
The best way to get off on the wrong foot is to join us late
without having attended, then try to browbeat us into offering credit for assignments that
your classmates managed to complete on time. In our view, planning, participation and timely
attention to detail has greater value as <em>not</em> participating or attending to details.
We use workmanship on early assignments when making decisions on teaming and tasking, so
consider seriously what we would have to work with.
Overall, <u>exercise of initiative in the interest of quality is rewarded</u>, so pay attention,
demonstrate decent critical thinking skills and focus on success from the start. Do that and
we'll make the semester worth your while. </P></li>

<li><strong>Assignments</strong> On the first day of the semester we will email you a Zoom
access link for class plus credentials for access to the class repository (which is one of
several ways we will communicate this semester.) Your first assignments (as above) will be
due by SOB on Thursday, January&nbsp;28th.
